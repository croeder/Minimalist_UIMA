So far, no substrates of PINK1 have been reported, and the mechanism by which PINK1 mutations lead to neurodegeneration is unknown. Here we report the identification of TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone also known as heat shock protein 75 (Hsp75), as a cellular substrate for PINK1 kinase. PINK1 binds and colocalizes with TRAP1 in the mitochondria and phosphorylates TRAP1 both in vitro and in vivo. We show that PINK1 protects against oxidative-stress-induced cell death by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and this protective action of PINK1 depends on its kinase activity to phosphorylate TRAP1. Moreover, we find that the ability of PINK1 to promote TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival is impaired by PD-linked PINK1 G309D, L347P, and W437X mutations. Our findings suggest a novel pathway by which PINK1 phosphorylates downstream effector TRAP1 to prevent oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis and implicate the dysregulation of this mitochondrial pathway in PD pathogenesis. </PARAGRAPH>\n"

Although the cause of PD is unknown, pathological analyses have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recently, an inherited form of early-onset PD has been linked to mutations in both copies of the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein PINK1. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that single-copy mutations in PINK1 are a significant risk factor in the development of later-onset PD. Here we show that PINK1 is a protein kinase that phosphorylates the mitochondrial molecular chaperone TRAP1 to promote cell survival. We find that PINK1 normally protects against oxidative-stress-induced cell death by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The PINK1 mutations linked to PD impair the ability of PINK1 to phosphorylate TRAP1 and promote cell survival. Our findings reveal a novel anti-apoptotic signaling pathway that is disrupted by mutations in PINK1. We suggest that this pathway has a role in PD pathogenesis and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. </PARAGRAPH>\n"

The cause of PD, particularly the sporadic disease, is unclear, but it likely involves both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have identified a number of genes associated with familial PD [ 2 ]. Postmortem analyses reveal a deficiency in the mitochondrial complex I function in patients with sporadic PD [ 3 ]. Furthermore, exposure to environmental toxins that inhibit the mitochondrial complex I can lead to PD-like phenotypes in animal models [ 4 ], suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis. </PARAGRAPH>\n"

+ "<ABSTRACT>		Abstract		BackgroundIn many countries, buprenorphine and methadone are licensed for the maintenance treatment (MT) of opioid dependence. Despite many short-term studies, little is known about the long-term (12-month) effects of these treatments in different settings, i.e. primary care-based (PMC) and specialized substitution centers (SSCs).		ObjectivesTo describe over a period of 12 months: (1) mortality, retention and abstinence rates; (2) changes in concomitant drug use, somatic and mental health; and (3) to explore differences between different types of provider settings.		Methods12-Month prospective-longitudinal naturalistic study with four waves of assessment in a prevalence sample of N=2694 maintenance patients, recruited from a nationally representative sample of N=223 substitution physicians.		ResultsThe 12-month retention rate was 75%; the mortality rate 1.1%. 4.1% of patients became “abstinent” during follow-up. 7% were referred to drug-free addiction treatment. Concomitant drug use decreased and somatic health status improved. No significant improvements were observed for mental health and quality of life. When controlling for initial severity, small PMC settings revealed better retention, abstinence and concomitant drug use rates.		ConclusionThe study underlines the overall 12-month effectiveness of various forms of agonist MT. Findings reveal relatively high retention rates, low mortality rates, and improvements in most 12-month outcome domains, except for mental health and quality of life. PMC settings appear to be a good additional option to improve access to MTs.			</ABSTRACT>\n"

+ "<PARAGRAPH>Considerable changes have occurred in the treatment and care structure for opioid addicts over the past decade. In addition to a wide range of existing drug-free psychosocial abstinence programs (McLellan et al., 1993; Vollmer and Krauth, 2001), increased emphasis was placed in the last decade on establishing outpatient methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) and buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT) for the management of opioid-dependent individuals. Maintenance treatments (MTs) are provided by either large-scale specialized substitution centers (SSCs) or, more recently, by office-based physicians who either specialize fulltime on MMT/BMT treatment provision or who treat a few maintenance patients only, mostly within the context of their main function as primary care doctors (Gossop et al., 2003; Merrill, 2002; Wittchen et al., 2005). The primary short-term goals of treatment are retention in treatment, reduction of medical and social-behavioral risks, reduction of harm and mortality associated with injecting and other concomitant drug use, and interruption of the vicious circles of drug intake and criminal acts. By involving patients in a continuous treatment plan, it is also expected to reduce the burden of associated mental and somatic morbidities (psychosis, depression, HIV, viral hepatitis, etc.) and the substantial social sequelae as intermediate goals. The controversial long-term goal of maintenance regimen is – in some countries explicitly – to help patients to ultimately quit the use of drugs entirely (abstinence) and to prepare them for the decision to enroll in a drug-free abstinence program. However, due to the lack of long-term data, it is unclear to what degree this goal is realistic.</PARAGRAPH>\n"
+ "\n"
+ "<PARAGRAPH>Agonist maintenance therapies with methadone or more recently buprenorphine are currently the two most frequently used maintenance treatment strategies for opioid dependence in the care system. In clinical trials, both flexible-dose MMT and BMT have been shown to be consistently effective in at least reducing illicit opioid use (Johnson et al., 1992; Ling et al., 1976; Strain et al., 1994; Connock et al., 2007). In combination with various degrees of psychosocial support and psychological treatment other beneficial outcomes have also been demonstrated in clinical studies (review by Connock et al., 2007; Wittchen et al., 2005; Gerra et al., 2004; Gossop et al., 2001; Kakko et al., 2003; King et al., 2002; Layson-Wolf et al., 2002; Ling and Wesson, 2003; Mattick et al., 2003, 2004; Poser and Poser, 1996; Soyka et al., 1997; Waal and Haga, 2003), for example, with regard to (a) improvement of the social situation, (b) reduction of drug-related crime, (c) reduction of morbidity and mortality rates, and (d) reduction of the transmission rate of HIV.</PARAGRAPH>\n"
+ "\n"
+ "<PARAGRAPH>Despite a considerable body of research (i.e. Connock et al., 2007; Gossop et al., 2001, 2003; King et al., 2002), several significant research deficits impede further progress. First, a lack of longitudinal studies in samples of unselected substitution settings and unselected samples of patients that inform us about how MT works under routine care conditions (Law and Nutt, 2003; Connock et al., 2007) and about the degree to which the assumed intermediate and long-term goals are reached in everyday practice. This deficit is regarded as an obstacle for the wider implementation of maintenance programs (Law and Nutt, 2003). Second, there is some evidence that the beneficial effects of MMT and BMT might be robust across different types of treatment settings. However the effects of different provider models and formats remain understudied, especially with regard to subgroups of addicts. Most available studies were undertaken in a few countries (US, UK, Australia) that have considerably different regulations and traditions than other countries (Connock et al., 2007). The German treatment system, for example, has been relatively slow in adopting MMT and BMT as first-line treatments for opioid-dependent individuals. Due to the existence of a wide range of specialized in- and outpatient long-term treatment programs established in the 1970s and 1980s, MMT programs were quite rare until the 1990s and were mainly provided by relatively few SSCs with quite restrictive regulations of access (Vollmer and Krauth, 2001; Wittchen et al., 2005). Although access to treatment programs remain up to now heavily regulated and rigidly controlled with quite restrictive criteria and quality assurance measures for access and management of patients, the number of institutions licensed to administer MMT and BMT have been largely increased during the past decade. Currently (2005) in Germany there are about 2500 medical doctors (with more than 65,000 maintenance patients), trained and licensed for MT, constituting a twofold increase over the rates before the year 2000 (Wittchen et al., 2005). This increase is mainly due to increasing number of smaller office-based physicians providing maintenance treatment. Stimulated by the availability of buprenorphine (Farell et al., 2000) and by evidence that maintenance in primary care settings may work (Gossop et al., 2001, 2003; Merrill, 2002; Salsitz et al., 2000), MMT and BMT in particular is increasingly offered by primary care doctors (PMC settings) or less frequently by psychiatrists and other specialists that frequently do not generally specialize on MMT and BMT, but rather manage only a few such patients within the context of their predominant and main function as a family doctor or specialist. Such PMC settings might differ in a number of aspects (e.g. climate, resources, expertise) that can be expected to affect quality of care and outcome. For example they typically do not have additional resources in terms of time, personnel and expertise to directly offer particularly the mandatory psychological and social interventions. Irrespective of this, these doctors have to follow, though, the same stringently enforced complex legislative regulations as specialized MT centers for example by collaboration with other institutions. The relative risks and benefits of maintenance treatments in such PMC contexts remain clearly understudied (Wittchen et al., 2005; Merrill, 2002).</PARAGRAPH>\n"

+ "<PARAGRAPH>Fig. 2a–c show the retention rates from baseline to 1-year follow-up, excluding n=274 patients that terminated the maintenance program because of either abstinence or referral to abstinence programs. Adjusted for differences between groups with regard to prior treatment duration, both medication groups reveal a steady decline of retention over the 52 weeks observation time of about 25%. Fig. 2c reveals that retention during the follow-up period is associated with length of previous retention in the treatment before baseline. Patients who had just started their current maintenance therapy in the 4 weeks prior to baseline, irrespective of type of medication, had the lowest retention rate as compared to patients with &gt;6 month (82%) prior treatment (61%, HR: 2.7; 95% CI: 2.1–4.4), followed by patients with 2–6 months prior treatment (70%, HR: 2.0 95% CI: 1.6–2.4). Fig. 2b reveals better long-term retention in PMC settings as compared to SSC (HR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1–1.7) largely due to changes after week 42. Reasons for not retaining patients in therapy were similar in most subgroups examined, except for the methadone group, for which more patients were not retained because of imprisonment (HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3–2.5).<ITALICS>n</ITALICS></PARAGRAPH>\n"
