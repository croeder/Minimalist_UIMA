	<body><ce:salutation>To the editors:</ce:salutation><ce:sections><ce:para>I was pleased to note the Editors&#x2019; Choice research article for the January 2006 edition of the <ce:italic>Journal</ce:italic> was &#x201C;Randomized trial of coached versus uncoached maternal pushing in the second stage of labor&#x201D; by Bloom et al.<ce:cross-ref refid="bib1"><ce:sup>1</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref> As summarized in the abstract &#x201C;the second stage of labor was abbreviated by approximately 13 minutes in coached women (<ce:italic>P</ce:italic> = .01).&#x201D; However, on inspection of Table III, it is evident that the distribution of the length of second stage in minutes is skewed in that the standard deviations are almost as large as the means (coached second stage minutes 46.3 &#x00B1; 41.5, uncoached second stage minutes 59 &#x00B1; 49.1). This type of distribution does not lend itself to statistical analysis with parametric tests and rather should be analyzed with a nonparametric measure. More importantly, although the authors state there is a 13-minute difference in the length of the second stage, we would really like to know what the difference was in the median and quartile values for these 2 populations. This will allow us to counsel patients, medical staff, and coaches more effectively. I urge the authors to reanalyze this critical measure of their study in such a way.</ce:para></ce:sections></body>
